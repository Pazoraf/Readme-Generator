# Readme-Generator


## Description
My intention with this project was to create an application to create a high-quality readme file for the users based on user inputted information. 
The application runs in the command-line and prompts users for information, and then creates and .md file containing the information the user provided appropriately formatted.
The application utilises Node.js along with the inquirer package.
